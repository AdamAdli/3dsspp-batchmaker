Might need to change some of these options:

	Anthropology:
		Male to Female, Weight/Height percentile, etc.
			Yes, batch file does give us the option to change percentiles and gender.
		Does shoes work?
			????	
	
	External Force:
		We don't touch this, keep default.

	When you go to print report option at the reports, 
	you see that we can identify the outputs,
	we want all of these outputs at the end of our analysis after each trial.
		Output of 3DSSPP is not required by my program.
